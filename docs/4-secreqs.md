# Security Requirements

1. An attacker should not be able to decode TV frames without a Decoder that has 
a valid, active subscription to that channel.
2. The Decoder should only decode valid TV frames generated by the Satellite 
System the Decoder was provisioned for.

Our implementation meets these requirements by using AEAD encryption. This
ensures that it is impossible to forge a frame without the encryption key. We
additionally have channel subscriptions include a different encryption key,
meaning that it is impossible to decode a frame without having a subscription,
and impossible to decode a subscription without it being destined for your
encoder.

3. The Decoder should only decode frames with strictly monotonically increasing 
timestamps.

The decoder keeps track of the timestamp of the last frame received. It compares
all incoming frames to this value, and rejects any which are not larger than the
last frames timestamp.
