# Security Requirements

1. An attacker should not be able to decode TV frames without a Decoder that has 
a valid, active subscription to that channel.
2. The Decoder should only decode valid TV frames generated by the Satellite 
System the Decoder was provisioned for.

Our implementation meets these requirements by using AEAD encryption. This
ensures that it is impossible to forge a frame without the encryption key. We
additionally have channel subscriptions include a different encryption key,
meaning that it is impossible to decode a frame without having a subscription.
