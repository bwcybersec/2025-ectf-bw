# BW eCTF 2025

This repository holds the BWCyberSecs's design for an eCTF Satellite TV System.

The tools work the same way that they do for the reference design, as is
required.

Of note is that the decoder is written in Rust. rust-toolchain.toml has been
placed so that you should be able to just use cargo if you are using a working
install of rustup.
